# HR EMPLOYEMENT ANALYSIS REPORT

## 1.	Project Objective:
-To explore the different distributions of workers in the company

## 2.	Dataset used:

## 3.	 Questions Answered(KPIs):
•	The gender breakdown of employees in the company?
•	The race/ethnicity breakdown of employees in the company?
•	The age distribution of employees in the company?
•	How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?
•	What is the average length of employment for employees who have been terminated?
•	How does the gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
•	What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
•	Which department has the highest turnover rate?
•	How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?
•	What is the tenure distribution for each department?

## 4.	Process of building the project:
i.	Data cleaning – changed the date in the birthdate, hire date and term date columns are in the same format and ensured that they are in stored as date datatype, 
ii.	Data preparation – created a new column of age by subtracting the current date from the birthdate.
iii.	Data processing – created excel files that answers each of the above KPIs and ensure that only employees with ages above the legal working age are considered.
iv.	Data visualization – imported the files into a visualization tool (powerbi) and the produced visuals that demonstrate the KPIs in a clear and understandable manner for the user of the information.

## 5.	Dashboard:
  
 

## 6.	Project Insights:
•	Gender balance leans slightly toward male employees. Inclusion of non-conforming gender identities is minimal and may benefit from inclusion initiatives.
•	There is racial diversity, though predominantly White. Opportunities still exist to further broaden representation across underrepresented racial groups.
•	While the majority of employees are HQ-based, a notable proportion of the workforce is remote, indicating adaptability in work arrangements.
•	A high average tenure suggests good employee retention, job satisfaction, or limited turnover.
•	A high average tenure suggests good employee retention, job satisfaction, or limited turnover.
•	Steady growth post-2005 implies organizational expansion and sustainability.
•	Ohio is the central employment hub. Regional strategies should prioritize these areas for HR support and initiatives.
•	The bulk of the workforce lies between ages 25 and 54, showing a mature employee base. Recruitment efforts may need to target younger demographics for sustainability.
•	Gender balance is maintained across all age brackets; however, non-conforming groups remain extremely underrepresented, therefore targeted efforts may help increase representation among younger and non-conforming employees.
•	Departments with high turnover may require workload assessments, improved support systems, or targeted retention strategies.
•	Gender imbalance in Engineering suggests a need for diversity initiatives in technical recruitment and development programs.

## 7.	Final Conclusion:

	Key Strengths:
o	High employee retention across the board indicates strong internal engagement and stability
o	Diverse racial representation with meaningful presence across multiple demographic groups
o	Balanced gender distribution in most departments, especially outside technical fields
o	Robust regional representation (especially in Ohio) that can support regional hub for training and development
o	Adoption of remote work by 25% of the staff demonstrates organizational flexibility

	Key Areas for Improvements:
o	Gender balance in Technical roles: Engineering is heavily male-dominated, suggesting a need for proactive gender equity initiatives.
o	Low representation of non-conforming genders: this highlights a gap in inclusive hiring and culture.
o	High termination rates in certain departments: Auditing and Legal show unusually high attrition, warranting a deeper investigation into departmental stressors or leadership challenges.
o	Underrepresentation Young Talent(18-24): The lowest employee counts are in the youngest age bracket. Succession planning and early career recruitment strategies are crucial.

	Strategic Takeaway:
While the organization demonstrates health in size, retention, and regional reach, long-term growth and equity will depend on:
o	Inclusive recruitment and retention practices
o	Addressing attrition in key departments
o	Attracting younger professionals
o	Promoting diversity in technical and leadership roles
